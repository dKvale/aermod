# aermod


The _aermod_ package provides a data frame interface for performing AERMOD runs from R. 

> __Disclaimer:__ It currently only runs a single source at a time.


**AERMOD** is a steady-state plume model that incorporates air dispersion based on planetary boundary layer turbulence and scaling concepts, including treatment of both surface and elevated sources, and both simple and complex terrain.

## Install 

```r
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github(c("dKvale/installEPA", 
                          "dKvale/bpip", 
                          "dKvale/receptors",
                          "dKvale/aermod"))
```

## Examples

Let's create an AERMOD receptor file: `receptors.rou`. We can set the grid to have circles of receptors at every 5 meters from 5 to 100 meters from the center point.
```r
library(aermod)
library(receptors)

recepts <- polar_grid(radii = seq(5, 100, 5))

write_rou(recepts, "receptors.rou")
```
