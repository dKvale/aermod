=======


The _aermod_ package provides a data frame interface for performing AERMOD runs from R. 


**AERMOD** is a steady-state plume model that incorporates air dispersion based on planetary boundary layer turbulence and scaling concepts, including treatment of both surface and elevated sources, and both simple and complex terrain.
